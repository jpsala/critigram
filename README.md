Critigram
=========

Easily view your [Criticker](http://www.criticker.com) ratings distribution by pasting your ratings history text export into this tool.

At present it will only divide the histogram by 10s, which is reasonable for the majority of users that use the whole 0-100 range.
Making this configurable to work with the 0-10 and 0-5 people isn't difficult, if there's interest.
